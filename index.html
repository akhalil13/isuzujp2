<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The difference between a dump truck and a transfer dump
truck is that the latter can carry more weight. A transfer dump truck can haul
between 26 and 27 short tons, slightly more than a dumper. Drivers can
transport three to five loads per day. However, the distance between trips will
determine how many loads they can transport each day. The distance between
trips will also determine how many trips they can make. Drivers should expect
to make three or five trips each day, depending on the size of the dump truck
they have.<o:p /></big></p>


<h2><big><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Articulated dump trucks</span></big><o:p /></big></h2>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>In order to keep your fleet running smoothly and
efficiently, Articulated Dump Trucks need regular maintenance. This may include
daily lubrication, tire inspections, structural component inspections and leak
detection. Some extreme conditions require more frequent filter changes or
engine pre-cleaners. If you are looking to buy a new dump truck, here are some
things to keep in mind. For more information, contact Ritchie Bros.
Auctioneers.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://www.isuzujp.com"><span style="font-weight: bold;">vacuum sewage truck</span></a><o:p /></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>The first articulated dump truck was a prototype developed
by Moxy in the early 1970s. It was a 6X6 with a bogie undercarriage. This
design made six drive wheels standard for articulated dump trucks. Its tighter
turning radius and better handling made it the first type of articulated dump
truck. However, it didn't last. Currently, only two major manufacturers
manufacture articulated dump trucks.</big></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Articulated dump trucks are ideal for construction work and
specialized jobs. The G series from Volvo has Dump Support System and Hill
Assist to help operators avoid hazardous terrain. It is also backed by a Fuel
Efficiency Guarantee and is built for durability. Articulated Dump Trucks also
require proper training to ensure safe and productive operation. There are several
hazards associated with operating an Articulated Dump Truck, so operators
should take the proper steps to avoid them.<o:p /></big></p>


<h2><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Site dumpers</span><o:p /></big></h2>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>For projects requiring a variety of materials, site dumpers
are an excellent choice. With their high ground clearance, torque and 25
percent gradeability, these machines are ideal for utilities, golf course and
landscaping projects. Depending on the size of the jobsite, these machines can
be matched with excavators, wheel loaders and skid steers to speed up material
movement cycle times and minimize jobsite cleanup. Learn more about site
dumpers and find the best one for your needs.<o:p /></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Site dumpers are vehicles that are used to transport large
amounts of bulk materials. Typically used for construction, site dumpers carry
building supplies, soil, trash and concrete. They resemble dump trucks but are
smaller. These vehicles are operated by an operator who sits in an open cab
with the load in front of him. The payload capacity of site dumpers varies, but
most are between one to six tons. The payload capacity of a site dumper varies,
depending on the size and weight of the materials to be dumped.<o:p /></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Mecalac introduces optional hydrostatic transmission on the
MDX site dumper. This replaces the mechanical transmission and ensures easier
operation. Combined with the hydrostatic transmission, this option is
especially suited for rental fleets. Also available on the MDX are cabs with an
isolated MDX cab that reduces vibration while ensuring operator well-being in
any weather conditions. In addition to a cabin, the MDX features a ROPS/FOPS
cabin, which allows for greater operator safety.<o:p /></big></p>


<h2><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">Front tippers</span><o:p /></big></h2>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Dump trucks have many variations, including tippers and site
dumpers. Site dumpers have a driver seated at the rear of the vehicle,
protecting him or her with roll-bars. Front tippers vary in size and can carry
from one to 10 tons of material. This versatility makes them an attractive
choice for the construction and civil engineering industries. To read more
about these types of dump trucks, click here. However, it's important to
understand the differences between the types.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://www.isuzujp.com" target="_blank"><span style="font-weight: bold;">tow truck</span></a><o:p /></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>Many of today's tipping trucks feature hydraulic rams. They
tilt the dump body to spill the material to the left or right. Most
manufacturers use twin slave hydraulic cylinders. In addition to being
efficient, they can also eliminate the need for spreading machinery. A recent
innovation from a German truck maker is a sleek, all-wheel-drive tipper. This
model also features hydraulic rams. And the front tippers on a dump truck are easy
to use.<o:p /></big></p>


<p class="MsoNormal"><big>A dump truck has many design options. Many are similar to
flatbed trucks. Larger trucks, however, have more axles and auxiliary
couplings. Depending on the type of project, the track size can be customized.
The size of the truck's track can be customized to fit the size of the site.
The tipper mechanism is also very popular in construction and mining. Although
the term dump truck has the same meaning in both countries, the term
"tipper" applies to a road-going version of the dump truck.<o:p /></big></p>
